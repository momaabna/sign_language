# Sign Language for Qur'an (Arabic Letters) Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation outlines a Python script designed to display sign language representations for Arabic letters, specifically tailored for Qur'an verses. The script utilizes OpenCV library to display images corresponding to Arabic letters as per the provided input text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library

## Usage
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
2. Prepare a text file containing the Arabic Qur'an verses. The text should be encoded in UTF-8.
3. Modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to the location of your text file.
4. Run the Python script.

## Script Explanation
- The script reads the text from the specified file.
- It replaces certain Arabic characters with their simplified counterparts to match available image files.
- Each character is then displayed using OpenCV with a corresponding image file representing the sign language gesture for that character.
- The script waits for a short duration between displaying each character to provide a smooth visual representation.

## Notes
- This script provides a basic demonstration of displaying sign language representations for Arabic Qur'an verses.
- Images used for sign language gestures should be appropriately sourced and organized for accurate representation.
- Further improvements can be made to enhance the user interface and optimize the code for better performance.

## Conclusion
This script offers a simple way to visualize sign language representations for Arabic Qur'an verses using OpenCV in Python. It serves as a starting point for developing more sophisticated applications in this domain.
